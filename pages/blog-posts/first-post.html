                <p>This is a photo taken of my younger sister Ella at Disney World. It believe it was taken with some sort of DSLR camera back in 2011.
                    I happened to find this picture while scrolling through my mom's old Facebook posts, and something about it struck me. I've hardly
                    known my sister to be as happy and silly as she was in this picture because we both had a rough childhood. When I look at this picture,
                    I see the last remnants of her innocence shining through her smile. She was authentically herself with no pain or fear holding her back.
                    Nowadays, she keeps to herself and doesn't smile. Recently, though, that pure joyous smile has been returning as she finds her footing.
                    I'm proud to know she is bouncing back and finding her happiness again.
