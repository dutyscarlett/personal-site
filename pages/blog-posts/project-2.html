                <p>Desires/Aversions
                </p>
                <p>
                    An personal aversion to boredom / a desire to stay occupied every waking hour becomes cultural when it results
                    in a community/society in which people are always busy and never spend meaningful time with other people, which in turn becomes
                    political when, as a community/soceity, people are too disconnected to engage in with their government in a productive manner.
                </p>
                <p>
                    A personal desire for trendy clothes / an aversion to "outdated" fashion becomes political when it means large corporations are given
                    more and more money every year to pump out fast fashion that destroys our planet and becomes cultural when these corporations and
                    the people around us encourage us to follow these trends for fear of missing out or being different.
                </p>
                <p>
                    A cultural desire for community / an aversion to socializing becomes personal when people are
                    unable to make friends or rely on the people around them because they are too selfish, anxious, or oblivious to socialize, which
                    becomes political for the same reasons as the first example.
